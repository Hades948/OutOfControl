## THANK YOU   
Thank you for playing my jam from the GMTK 2020 game jam! Hopefully, 
you like it but if not, please feel free to send me your feedback at 
hades948@gmail.com!   
   
## Controls   
This game is unique in that the controls change on the fly. Every time 
your player passes the green beacon, your control mappings will be 
altered.  You can view your current controls in the top left of the 
screen. Be careful, though! The ground is slippery and the player is 
Out of Control!
